I used program languages: a lot - javascript, php; a few - c#, bs, as. Spent a lot of time with mysql and postgresql. I worked a lot with REST and SOAP for API and bridges to Lotus, a several years used xml/xslt and json stuctures. I use vector editing prorgam CorelXara every week and video editing software Adobe After Effect and Adobe Premier a several times a year for my personal goals. I spent a lot of time working with computer hardware between 1995 and 2010.

Now I use Microsoft Project, Jira/Confluence every day because My major work is management of software development (analysts, backend and frontend engeneers, quality assurance engeneers and deployment services). I had experience with youtrack, asana and b24. I often use miro and draw.io for modeling processes, and I like togaf notation. Of course I use Microsoft Office software every day.
